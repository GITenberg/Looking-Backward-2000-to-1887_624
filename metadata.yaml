description: Looking Backward by Edward Bellamy is a novel that takes the reader from
  the end of the 19th century into an idealistic vision of the 21st century. In many
  ways Looking Backward is a 19th century romantic novel; yet, on another level the
  novel is a complex investigation of the possibilities of humanity as the conversations
  unfold between Julian West, the narrator and time traveler, and Dr. leetee, his
  21st century guide and mentor. Through these often Socratic conversations, Bellamy
  provides the reader with insight into the social problems and ills of the mid-to-late
  19th century as well as with a vision of a utopian possibility for the millennium.
